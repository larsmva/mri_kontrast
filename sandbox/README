I've made a simplied version of Lars' solver. 


Things to do: 
 * run freesurfer on Abel (will be needed when we have many patients)  
 * check out TSD
 * do a refinement study wrt both space and time  
 * do a refinement study wrt both space and time with physically correct quantities 
 * set up a Abel script to run multiple versions of this script with different dt, refimenents etc.
